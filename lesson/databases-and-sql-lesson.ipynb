    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, you have been performing operations on datasets that can fit on local storage (your computer's hard disk or SSD). However, in a production context, it is far more common for companies to store data on some remote server and extract subsets of it for analysis where necessary. This is for two reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the amount of data that a company has might be measurable only in terabytes (thousands of gigabytes). That won't fit on your computer. Also, while `pandas` works great for interactive analysis, it's not built for stability and concurrency. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that data is often stored not in CSVs and JSONs, but rather in *databases*. When you work with a database, you don't need to worry about *how* it stores data, but only about how to access it. At this point, we'll be focusing on *relational databases*, which allow you to treat data like tables of rows and columns, just like you're used to in `pandas`. The strength of these databases is that they make four strong guarantees, which you can remember with **ACID**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A**tomicity (what happens when reads and writes occur simultaneously?)\n",
    "* **C**onsistency (how do we prevent data corruption?)\n",
    "* **I**solation (how do we support multiple connections at once?)\n",
    "* **D**urability (what happens to the data if we lose power?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common way to interact with such databases, by far, is some variant of *Structured Query Language* (SQL). While there exist multiple dialects (sqlite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle...), the differences are largely minor and syntactical."
